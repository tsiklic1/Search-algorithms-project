Hey can you please help me, i have to use simulated annealing
with a labyrinth that is described with a tree that looks like this

0 1 3 
1 2 9 
3 4 5 
4 6 7 8 

First number is the parent node and other numbers are children NODES

I also have this information about EDGES
0 1 1
0 3 3
1 2 2
1 9 8
3 4 2
3 5 4
4 6 2
4 7 4
4 8 4

Here the first number is always the parent node
second number is child node and third number is the distance between the 
two nodes (so basically how many steps of labyrinth)
